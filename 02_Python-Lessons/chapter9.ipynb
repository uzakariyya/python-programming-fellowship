    "\n",
    "1. In this chapter you’ll write classes () and \n",
    "2. create instances of those classes. \n",
    "3. You’ll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances, and you’ll define actions that can be taken with these instances.\n",
    "4. You’ll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share common functionality, and you can do more with less code.\n",
    "5. You’ll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files"

    "\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. \n",
    "- In object-oriented programming, you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Classes in Python\n",
    "- Classes provide an easy way of keeping the data members and methods together in one place, which helps keep the program more organized.\n",
    "- Using classes also provides another functionality of this object-oriented programming paradigm, that is, inheritance.\n",
    "- Classes also help in overriding any standard operator.\n",
    "- Using classes provides the ability to reuse the code, which makes the program more efficient.\n",
    "- Grouping related functions and keeping them in one place (inside a class) provides a clear structure to the code, which increases the readability of the program.\n",

    "If we’re only describing one car, it’s probably fine to associate the method `get_range()` with the `Battery` class. However, if we’re describing a manufacturer’s entire line of cars, it might make more sense to move `get_range()` to the `ElectricCar` class.  \n",
